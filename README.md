# Sample apps from Choosing a JavaScript Framework

These are the (very, very) simple sample applications walked through
in the (upcoming) Choosing a JavaScript Framework book, from [Bleeding Edge Press](http://bleedingedgepress.com).

## Serve Files

If you need a web server, install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), then execute:

```
npm install
./serve.js
```

The files in this application will then be accessible at [http://localhost:8080]() as long as the process is running;
`Ctrl-C` to kill the server.
